------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: You must eliminate all green and gray blocks on the grid
Obstacles: You may not destroy red blocks in the process or let green or gray blocks fall off the screen.

The blocks move towards you at a specific speed and if they run over you they will move at a faster speed (basically impossible to play at...so don't get run over!)

To eliminate blocks, press A to set a bomb at your location (shown with a blue border around that space on the grid) and move. When the block you want to eliminate is on top of your bomb, press A again and it will be eliminated.

If you eliminate a green block, a green bomb will be set in the location you eliminated it at (shown with a green border around that space on the grid). When you detonate a green bomb (by pressing B) all blocks surrounding that bomb will be eliminated as well (a 3x3 sqare). 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If another green block is eliminated in the process of detonating a green bomb, another green bomb will be set. 

You can have multiple green bombs set at once, and pressing B will detonate all of them. You can also set blue bombs while green bombs are active. Pressing A will only detonate blue bombs, and you can only set one blue bomb at a time.

If you eliminate a red block, you will get a strike. If you fail to eliminate a green or gray block before it falls off the grid, you will get a strike per block failed to eliminate. If you have more than three strikes, then the game is over and your "IQ" will be calculated based on your performance.

There are six levels. Good luck!

Note: A score over 140 does not certify genius, simply indicates someone proficient at puzzle games. :)
